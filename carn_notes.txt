STATUS ref/def (again, why?)

Macros in ASM file to new format i.e:

.macro
.if
.endm

shawn.hdr mostly from NBA Jam, that code works with gspa 6.10 otherwise it was a mess.

HSTD Macros replaced with versions from NBA Jam (again) to work with gspa 6.10

This one starts at FFC00000 so sys.inc and linker CMD are ok.

Lots of corrupt tables/sprites.
